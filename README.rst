# Transform Learning for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

Transform-learning NMF is a new method for music signal processing. Standard NMF is applied on the spectrogram of the musical signal. The spectrogram is classicaly obtained as the power of the Fourier transform of small windows of the signal. Instead of using the Fourier transform, TL-NMF learns it from the signals.
